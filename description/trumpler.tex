Concentration
\begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item Detached: strong concentration toward center.
    \item Detached: weak concentration toward center.
    \item Detached: no concentration toward center.
    \item Not well detached from surrounding star field.
\end{enumerate}

Brightness range
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Small range in brightness.
    \item Moderate range in brightness.
    \item Large range in brightness.
\end{enumerate}

Richness
\begin{itemize}
    \item[p] Poor (less than 50 stars).
    \item[m] Moderately rich (50-100 stars).
    \item[r] Rich (more than 100 stars).
    \item[n] nebulosity is associated with the cluster.
